I recreated Absurdle, as found here: https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html.
Absurdle is a harder version of Wordle--instead of starting with a set solution, it
has a list of potential solutions that the user must narrow down with guesses so that
only one remains. The remaining potential solutions after each guess are those
associated with the largest-sized "bucket," which is the largest set of potential
solutions matching a possible color pattern response to the user's guess. The user may
enter a guess by pressing keys on the keyboard or by clicking keys on the on-screen
keyboard. By default, the maximum number of guesses is eight, but a lower maximum
number may be specified using an integer command-line argument.
